    textResponse: It's not real. It is literally all a game. Guaire hasn't finished
      this dungeon yet, nor has he even finished the game! That's why no one talks,
      the inventory system is doesn't function, and why the art looks like placeholders!
      The only way out is to KILL Guaire! I am here as well, I remain nearby. Keep
      progressing as normal.
